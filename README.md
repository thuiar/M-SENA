## M-SENA: An Integrated Platform for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

> **Note:** M-SENA is a research project, and is for demonstration purposes only. We give our best effort to make the platform run smoothly but we make no guarantees about the robustness of the platform. For meticulous research purposes, we recommand using the toolkits listed below, which are dedicated to reproduceable experiments and benchmarks. 

**M-SENA** is an open-sourced platform for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis. It aims to facilitate advanced research by providing flexible toolkits, reliable benchmarks, and intuitive demonstrations. 

The platform integrates two of our research toolkits, we highly recommand advanced researchers to use these toolkits: 

- [MMSA](https://github.com/thuiar/MMSA): *A unified framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, dedicated to fair and reproduceable experiments.*
- [MMSA-FET](https://github.com/thuiar/MMSA-FET): *A Feature Extraction Toolkit compatible with MMSA, can extract highly customized modality features.* 


## Installation

The platform is developed with frontend and backend seperated into two repos. Follow the instructions in these repos to set up frontend and backend on your server. You can deploy frontend and backend on separate servers. 

- [M-SENA Frontend](https://github.com/FlameSky-S/M-SENA-frontend)
